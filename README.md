# Customer_Shopping_Behaviour_Analysis-
Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis using Python, SQL (PostgreSQL), and Power BI with interactive dashboard and business insights.
1. Project Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional data from 3,900 purchases across multiple product categories. The main objective is to uncover insights related to spending patterns, customer segments, product preferences, discounts, and subscription behavior to support data-driven business decisions.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow using Python, SQL (PostgreSQL), and Power BI.

2. Tools & Technologies Used
Python: Pandas, NumPy
Database: PostgreSQL
Visualization: Power BI
Version Control: GitHub
3. Dataset Summary
Total Rows: 3,900
Total Columns: 18
Key Features
Customer Demographics: Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status
Purchase Details: Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount, Season, Size, Color
Shopping Behavior: Discount Applied, Promo Code Used, Previous Purchases, Frequency of Purchases, Review Rating, Shipping Type
Data Quality
Missing Values: 37 missing values found in the review_rating column
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Data preparation and cleaning were performed using Python:

Steps Performed
Data Loading: Imported dataset using Pandas

Initial Exploration: Used df.info() and df.describe() for structure and summary statistics

Missing Value Treatment: Imputed missing values in review_rating using the median rating of each product category

Column Standardization: Converted column names to snake_case for consistency

Feature Engineering:

Created age_group column by binning customer ages
Created purchase_frequency_days feature based on purchase behavior
Data Consistency Check:

Identified redundancy between discount_applied and promo_code_used
Dropped promo_code_used column
Database Integration:

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL for SQL-based analysis
5. Data Analysis Using SQL (PostgreSQL)
SQL queries were written to answer key business questions:

Revenue by Gender – Compared total revenue generated by male and female customers
High-Spending Discount Users – Identified customers using discounts while spending above average
Top 5 Products by Rating – Ranked products based on average review ratings
Shipping Type Comparison – Compared average purchase amount for Standard vs Express shipping
Subscribers vs Non-Subscribers – Analyzed average spend and total revenue by subscription status
Discount-Dependent Products – Found top 5 products with highest percentage of discounted purchases
Customer Segmentation – Classified customers as New, Returning, or Loyal based on purchase history
Top 3 Products per Category – Identified most purchased products in each category
Repeat Buyers & Subscriptions – Evaluated whether customers with more than 5 purchases are more likely to subscribe
Revenue by Age Group – Calculated revenue contribution across different age groups
6. Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize insights such as:

Revenue distribution by age group and gender
Subscriber vs non-subscriber performance
Product category performance
Discount impact on sales
Shipping type comparison

7. Business Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations were derived:

Boost Subscriptions: Offer exclusive benefits and personalized deals to subscribers
Customer Loyalty Programs: Incentivize repeat buyers to convert them into loyal customers
Review Discount Strategy: Optimize discount usage to balance sales growth and profit margins
Product Positioning: Promote top-rated and best-selling products in marketing campaigns
Targeted Marketing: Focus campaigns on high-revenue age groups and Express shipping users

8. Key Learnings
End-to-end data analysis workflow from raw data to business insights
Practical application of Python for data cleaning and feature engineering
Writing complex SQL queries for business analysis
Building interactive dashboards using Power BI
